            <div class="initiative-badge">UK Responsible AI Initiative</div>
            <p>RAMICS is a multi-disciplinary project within the UK's Responsible AI initiative, focused on developing approaches for responsibly implementing adaptive multi-human multi-robot (MHMR) systems in complex social environments. Operating as an integrator project, RAMICS specifically targets the care environment sector, such as care homes, where despite the clear benefits and rising demand for assistive technologies and the introduction of robotics and AI, significant barriers hinder their adoption in real-world practice. By combining expertise in human factors and healthcare technologies, we address crucial sociotechnical issues in the deployment of these systems, aiming to bridge the gap between innovative technology and practical implementation in healthcare settings.</p>
